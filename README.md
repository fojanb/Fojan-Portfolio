## Landing Page

A standalone web page that potential customers can “land” on when they click through from an email, ad, or other digital location. A landing page aims to capture information from contacts in exchange for something of value, such as a retail offer code or business-to-business (B2B) insights in the form of a white paper. Landing pages are different from other web pages in that they don’t live in the evergreen navigation of a website. They serve a specific purpose in a specific moment of an advertising campaign to a target audience.
A website’s homepage usually provides a general overview of a business. But if you have a specific, short-term goal, a landing page is a valuable online marketing channel that can help you reach that goal in the buyers journey.

## What is a landing page?

A landing page is a standalone web page that a person "lands" on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location.

Once they’re on your landing page, users are encouraged to take an action, such as joining your list or buying your products. If the user takes the specific desired action, then your landing page has succeeded in getting them to convert.

Typically, landing pages only encourage their users to take one such action, like to fill out the custom signup form on the page. Why?

It’s because of what researchers call the “paradox of choice.” In simple terms, that means that the more options you give people, the harder it is for them to make a decision and act.

Imagine you're offering a free ebook. But on your landing page, you also invite your users to visit your blog and buy a product and check out your social media channels. With each ask, the chances of your users downloading your new ebook grow slimmer because you've directed their attention away from your primary objective.

On the extreme end, too many choices can overwhelm your users, causing them to stall and take no action at all. This is why it’s critical to focus on a single call to action (CTA) rather than 3 or 4.

This is why a landing page should have a clear visual hierarchy and value proposition, and should be tested for the best conversion optimization
